The purpose of these scripts is to facilitate an
semi-automated installation All scripts end with ".sh"
and are shipped to you in a safe, inactive state
These scripts must be give exicutability (chmod +x)
in order to do anything except look pretty =]

To run the entire install process, run the 
"installer.sh" script. Crossing fingers, praying, 
rabbing a rabbit's foot, and other riturals for the
encouragement of good fortune are recommended but not required

Individual scripts can be run independantly
however you should verify that the required 
files have been generated (or provide them yourself)

Currently only FLATDHCP networking is included
this install is hard-coded for servers with a single ethernet adaptor
these limitations will be addressed as time permits

User interaction is required
There has been some steps introduced 
to reduce input error, but data sanitation
is far from complete

Most intallation steps are modular, so that 
some steps can be skipped if installation of 
one element is not desired (ie expanding services
to another node)



Any feed-back on these scripts would be greatly appreciated
